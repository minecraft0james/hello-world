# hello-world
For GCI
hello my name is james and I like computers. 
More specificly I enjoy Building them and am I computer hardware enthusiast,
I have recently built myself a r7 2700 16gb ddr4 and a rtx 2060 gaming pc
I chose to work on this course as I wanted to learn more about computer science and to possibly learn a new language or two along the way.
